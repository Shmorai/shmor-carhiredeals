# CarHireDeals (carhiredeals.shmor.ai)

A Shmor marketplace (shared rules in `../../CLAUDE.md`): its own brand, design and SEO. Car hire and rental car deals compared across the major brands, at airports and local depots in the USA, UK, Europe and worldwide. Repo: `Shmorai/shmor-carhiredeals` (private until launch). Status: **building**.

## Where things are
| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Card on shmor.ai, search keywords, **referral links**, offers, SEO defaults | `shmor-site.json` |
| Pages (1 JSON file = 1 Google landing page) | `content/` (`home.json` = homepage) |
| Design: header, logo, footer | `templates/layout.html` |
| Design: styles | `assets/site.css` (kit defaults; add this site's theme block at the bottom) |
| Generated output (don't edit by hand) | `index.html`, `*/index.html`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `404.html`, `search/` |

## Design
Not designed yet: still the kit's default theme. Give it its own look (see `../shmor-traveldeals/` for a finished example) and record the palette here.

## Commands (run here)
```bash
node tools/build.js           # rebuild after ANY change to content/, templates/ or shmor-site.json
node tools/serve.js <port>    # local preview (see the "carhiredeals" preview config)
```
After changing `shmor-site.json`, also run `node tools/sync-network.js` in `../../shmor-ai`.

## Referral links
Add to `shmor-site.json` → `"links"`, list slugs in a page's `"partners"` (or add `"offers"`), rebuild, sync the master, then commit both repos.
